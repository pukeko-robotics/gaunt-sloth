 * multi-line echo-redirect that wrote 0 bytes, a PowerShell here-string, `python -c` multi-line).

 * `run_shell_command`, so GS2-27 composes it in the shared path.
 *
 * The shell is derived from the SAME rule Node's `spawn(command, { shell: true })` uses — exactly
 * how `run_shell_command` spawns (GthDevToolkit spawn) — so on `win32` it is cmd.exe (via

 * `process.platform` at call time so the text is correct per host. Returns the note alone when
 * there is no base prompt. A single injection is authoritative (nothing in the base prompt
